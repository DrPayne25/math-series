# Lab 02

**Author**: Alex Payne
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This will be a way to create 3 functions 1 that based on your input will tell you which number in the fibonacci sequence that is. Another that will do the same but with the lucas series. And finally one that will allow you to pick which series to use based on two more parameters  

## Getting Started
1. Create a new poetry project this one is called math-series
2. Setup as normal per this guide https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/reference/submission-instructions/labs/
